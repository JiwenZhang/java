AOP Homework

Task:
implement PointCut, AfterReturn, AfterThrow

What I have implemented:
AfterReturn, AfterThrow

In order to test AfterThrow annotation, I added one more method called test in EmployeeeService. 
This method throws a NullPointerException and it will be caught by InvocationTargetException.

Results:
Two annotations works well.
